# A8-Conways-Game-of-Life

This game is based on Conway's Game of Life. Built using the Model-View-Controller Design Pattern in Java Swing,
the program features various additional customization options like the ability to change the board size and survival thresholds.
This program was my 8th and final programing project for my COMP 401 class at UNC Chapel Hill.

The main method for launching the game is found in the A8 package/folder. Enjoy!
